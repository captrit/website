# Welcome to the Future of Cybersecurity

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated. At Captrit, we understand the critical importance of protecting your valuable digital assets from these emerging threats.

## Why Cybersecurity Matters More Than Ever

The digital transformation has accelerated across industries, creating unprecedented opportunities but also exposing organizations to new vulnerabilities. Consider these statistics:

- Cybercrime costs are projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025
- A business falls victim to a ransomware attack every 11 seconds
- 95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error

This is why having a robust cybersecurity strategy is no longer optionalâ€”it's essential for business survival.
